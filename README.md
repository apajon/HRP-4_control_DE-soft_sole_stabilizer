# HRP-4_control_DE-soft_sole_stabilizer

HRP-4 playback bridge with multi-task Qp controller. 
Alls cripts are developped for multi-contact ROS package developped at CNRS LIRMM and CNRS-AIST JRL with HRP-2 and HRP-2.


In /scripts all :

-test_playback_bridge.py and zmp_com_playback_bridge
are to control HRP-4 with WPG and DE to walk with soft soles


-test_playback_bridge_stableloop.py, zmp_com_playback_bridge_stableloop.py, zmp_com_playback_bridge_controlloop.py and zmp_com_playback_bridge_controlloop_global.py are to control HRP-4 with WPG and closed-loop controller for stable walking with soft soles
